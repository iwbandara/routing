OSPF Protocol
=============

=> This is an open protocol.

=> Uses Dijkstra algorithm for cost calculations. It is also called Shortest Path First (SPF).

=> Calculation formula; 
      OSPF Cost = Reference Bandwidth/ Interface Bandwidth (Reference B/W is 100 by default)

=> Administrative distance (AD is 110).

=> It is called a Link-state routing protocol and supports unlimited number of hop count.

=> Hello packets are used update the neighbors. Their default timers are, Hello->10s & Dead->40s

=> To become ospf neighbors both hello and dead timers should be matched. When sending "Hello" packets they are sent to a multicast address of 224.0.0.5.

=> Router ID is an IP Address used to identify the routers in OSPF process.

=> Has seven states. They are, Down->Init->2-Way->ExStart->Exchange->Loading->Full

Configuration:
==============

=>       Router(config)# router ospf <process_number> (0 - 65535) // This value is locally significant. Must not match with other routers
         Router(config-router)# router-id X.X.X.X 
         Router(config-router)# network X.X.X.X A.A.A.A area 0 (X.X.X.X => Network Address, A.A.A.A => Wildcard Mask)
         Router(config-router)# auto-cost reference-bandwidth <1-4294967> // This value must match in with all participating routers
         Router(config-router)# passive-interface <interface-name> // Interface will stop sending Hello out this reducing bandwidth as well as improve security.

Verification:
=============

=> Router# show ip protocols // Display information on routing protocols configured on the router

=> Router# show ip ospf protocols // Display OSPF specific information

=> Router# show ip route ospf // Display only the OSPF learned routes

=> Router(config-router)# default-information originate // Educate other routers to forward traffic which they do not know the destination

=> In case if you do not have a default route configured, can use the below command.
      Router(config-router)# default-information originate always

=> In multi-access network a Designated Router (DR) and a Backup Designated Router (BDR) is elected. Thet will have full adjacency with other routers which are called DROTHER.

=> OSPF works with concept or Areas, the default area is Area 0. Also called as backbone area.

=> OSPF does not support automatic summarization by default like EIGRP protocol. 

=> OSPF can summarize routes only on ABRs and ASBRs.

=> OSPF Stub area types:
      1. Stub Areas // No Type 5 LSAs (External LSAs) & No ASBR allowed
      2. Totally Stub Areas // No Type 3 & Type 5 LSAs and No ASBR allowed
      3. Not So Stuby Areas (NSSA) // No Type 5 LSAs & ASBR allowed
      4. Totally NSSA // No Type 3 and Type 5 LSAs & ASBR allowed

=> OSPF Route Summarization:
      Can be done on an ABR or an ASBR, but the methods are different.

      On an ASBR:      
            Router(config)# router ospf 10
            Router(config-router)# summary-address 172.16.0.0 255.255.252.0

      On an ABR:
            Router(config)# router ospf 10
            Router(config-router)# area 10 range 172.16.0.0 255.255.252.0
