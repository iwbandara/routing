OSPF Protocol
=============

=> This is an open protocol

=> Uses Dijkstra algorithm for cost calculations. It is also called Shortest Path First (SPF).

=> Calculation formula; 
      OSPF Cost = Reference Bandwidth/ Interface Bandwidth (Reference B/W is 100 by default)

=> Administrative distance (AD is 110).

=> It is called a Link-state routing protocol and supports unlimited number of hop count.

=> Hello packets are used update the neighbors. Their default timers are, Hello->10s & Dead->40s

=> To become ospf neighbors both hello and dead timers should be matched.

=> Router ID is an IP Address used to identify the routers in OSPF process.

Configuration
=============

=>       Router(config)# router ospf <process_number> (0 - 65535)
         Router(config-router)# router-id X.X.X.X 
         Router(config-router)# network X.X.X.X A.A.A.A area 0 (X.X.X.X => Network Address, A.A.A.A => Wildcard Mask)

=> Router(config-router)# default-information originate // Educate other routers to forward traffic which they do not know the destination

=> In case if you do not have a default route configured, can use the below command.
      Router(config-router)# default-information originate always

=> In multi-access network a Designated Router (DR) and a Backup Designated Router (BDR) is elected. Thet will have full adjacency with other routers which are called DROTHER.

=> OSPF works with concept or Areas, the default area is Area 0. Also called as backbone area.
