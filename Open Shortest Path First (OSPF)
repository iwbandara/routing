OSPF Protocol
=============

=> This is an open protocol

=> Uses Dijkstra algorithm for cost calculations.

=> Calculation formula; 
      OSPF Cost = Reference Bandwidth/ Interface Bandwidth (Reference B/W is 100 by default)

=> Administrative distance (AD is 110.

=> It is called a Link-state routing protocol and supports unlimited number of hop count.

=> Hello packets are used update the neighbors. Their default timers are, Hello->10s & Dead->40s

=> To become ospf neighbors both hello and dead timers should be matched.

=> Router ID is an IP Address used to identify the routers in OSPF process.
