Border Gateway Routing Protocol (BGP)
=====================================

=> This is the routing protocol used in the Internet.
=> Known as an External Gateway Protocol (EGP). It is the only EGP we have.
=> A path-vector routing protocol
=> Very slow compared to other protocols used such as OSPF, EIGRP, etc.
=> Do not advertise routing information to neighbors. Manual configuration is required.
=> Autonomous System (AS) number is assigned by IANA.  Originally it was 2-bytes (16-bits), means ranging from 0 - 65535.
=> RFC 4893 defines 4-bytes for new AS number, which is 32-bits.
=> There are two (02) flavours of AS numbers, Private & Public.
=> When performing neighborship, the router which has lowest RID become the ACTIVE router (port no greater than 1023) and other router become the passive router which 
   has TCP 179 port always.


Configuration:
==============

R1(config)# router bgp 1 // 1 is the Autonomous System (AS) number

R1(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.12.1 remote-as 2 // IP Address of the neighbor router is AS number

R1(config-router)# network 200.0.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0 // Advertises the specified network

By default eBGP will have a value of 1 for TTL, which means eBGP router can reach on the directly connected routers. If they are more than one hop away we need to 
increment the TTL value with the "ebgp-multihop" command in router mode.

R1(config-router)# neighbor X.X.X.X ebgp-multihop 2 // Increases the TTL value to 2.

Verification:
=============

R1# show ip bgp summary // To check if bgp neighbors are available

R1# show ip bgp // Display the BGP database

BGP Path Selection:
==================

=> When selecting path in BGP multiple attributes are taken into consideration.
=> Four (04) of them are important. They are listed below as per the order;
      Weight -> Local Preference -> AS path -> MED
