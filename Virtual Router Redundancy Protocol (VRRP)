Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP):
==========================================

=> VRRP is very similar to HSRP.

=> It is an open protocol.

=> Active router is called Master & standby router is called Backup.

=> VRRP sends its advertisements using 224.0.0.18 multicast address.

=> The virtual router MAC address is of the form 0000.5e00.01XX, where XX is the group no in Hexadecimal.

=> VRRP group numbers range from 0 to 255.

=> Router priority range from 1 to 254. Default value is 100.

Configuration:

  R1(config)# interface <interface-number>
  R1(config-if)# vrrp <group-no> ip <virtual-ip-address>
  R1(config-if)# vrrp <group-no> priority <value> // ranges from 1 to 254 (Default 100)
