OSPF Protocol
=============

=> This is an open protocol

=> Uses Dijkstra algorithm for cost calculations.

=> Calculation formula; 
      OSPF Cost = Reference Bandwidth/ Interface Bandwidth (Reference B/W is 100 by default)

=> Administrative distance (AD is 110.

=> It is called a Link-state routing protocol and supports unlimited number of hop count.
