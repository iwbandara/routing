Border Gateway Routing Protocol (BGP)
=====================================

=> A path vector routing protocol
=> Very slow compared to other protocols used such as OSPF, EIGRP, etc.
=> Do not advertise routing information to neighbors. Manual configuration is required.

Configuration:
==============

R1(config)# router bgp 1 // 1 is the Autonomous System (AS) number
R1(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.12.1 remote-as 2 // IP Address of the neighbor router is AS number

Verification:
=============

R1# show ip bgp summary // To check if bgp neighbors are available

R1# show ip bgp // Display the BGP database
