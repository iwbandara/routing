Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol [EIGRP]:
======================================================

=> EIGRP is an enhanced distance vector routing protocol. It does not have certain limitations found in other protocols such as RIP.

=> EIGRP uses the Diffusing update algorithm (DUAL) to identify network paths and enable fast convergence.

=> Configuration:
	R1(config)# router eigrp <AS-Number>
	R1(config-router)# eigrp router-id 1.1.1.1 // Manually configure the router id
	R1(config-router)# network x.x.x.x x.x.x.x // enables the specified network
	R1(config-router)# no auto-summary // disable network summarization

=> Verification:

	R1# show ip protocols

	R1# show ip eigrp neighbors

	R1# show ip eigrp topology

	R1# show ip eigrp route

=> By default EIGRP uses Bandwidth and Delay when calculating the metric.

=> Metric = 256[(10000000/ Min. B/W)+ (Total Delay/10)]

=> Can change the Bandwidth and delay for the purpose of calculations.

=> How to change the B/W:

	Router(config)# interface G0/1
	Router(config-if)# bandwidth 500 // the value in Kilobits per second

=> How to change the Delay:
	
	Router(config)# interface G0/1
	Router(config-if)# delay 100

=> What is Delay:-> 
	
	-> The time it will take for packets to cross the link and it is a static value.
	
	-> Cisco IOS will have default delay values for different interfaces. A FastEthernet interface has a default delay value of 100 usec.

=> Feasible Distance (FD) is the source router's metric value to the destination.

=> Reported/Advertised Distance (RD/AD) is the neighbor router's metric value to the destination.

=> Successor = the route with the lowest metric value to the destination (the best route)

=> Feasible Successor = the alternate route to the destination, which meets the feasibility condition.

=> EIGRP uses five different types of packets;
